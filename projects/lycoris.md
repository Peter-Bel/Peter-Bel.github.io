  Lycoris is a lengthy metroidvania platformer game that I developed with my friend Joana back in high school. In total, this project took about 6 months of work and required a lot of collaboration. I was the lead programmer and sprite artist of the project while Joana focused on level design and music.  
  
  The game starts with the player character shackled and confined to a small room. Exploring the world from this point only leads to dangerous monsters and powerful bosses. However, it's not hopeless for the player. The player is capable of replenishing health by defeating enemies. There are also many large statues that can heal the player and unlock stat bonuses. As the game progresses, the player will gain more abilities turning this daunting world into one they can conquer.

  The sheer length and complexity of the project definitely evolved my abilities as a programmer. I had to program the collisions, player states, enemies and bosses, cutscenes, room data, and more. Objects like the boss characters and the player each have over 1000 lines of code, and other objects like the enemies would each have hundreds of lines of code. As labor intensive as this was, I had a lot of fun with this project and it inspired me to continue my programming journey.
