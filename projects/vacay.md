In Spring 2023, I participated in the robotics program at Kapi'olani Community College. This project had us research and program Nao Robots to do certain tasks. In the end, we would present our project at the KCC SURF fair for Spring 2023. 

While we had hoped to create a complex and interesting program that the Nao Robots could perform, the real difficulty of the project was simply finding and creating documentation to program the robots. The language the robotics team previously used was called Choreographe, and this language has very little documentation and support. In fact, the company behind the robots seemed to be in financial struggle and in the middle of a merger to another company. This meant that support and updates to the robots were non-existant. Because Choreographe was a limiting coding base, the project ultimately shifted towards getting Ros (a robot programming language with more support and documentation) installed on the Nao robots and programming from there. 

I ultimately came up short when it came to incorporating the Ros language. It required the use of Ubuntu, an OS I've never used. Also, because the documentation was so little, it became an extreme case of trial and error of trying to use pieces of code that I didn't understand fully. 

However, towards the end, the teacher and some of the students were able to get the language operating on the robots. I was able to work in the Ros language and code basic functions like having the robot move in a circle. While this wasn't much, the process of research and failure helped me learn many things about the programming process. I learned about the importance of documenting code and what to do when resources are low.
