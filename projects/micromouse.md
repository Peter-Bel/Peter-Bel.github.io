This java language project involved developing a Pokemon object that stores the stats and names of different Pokemon. The system would be capable of printing the following information about each pokemon:

```cpp
Species: <Pokemon species>
Name: <Pokemon name>
Number: <number>
Type: <type1> | <type2>
HP: <hitPnts>
CP: <comPwr>
```

This program is also capable of setting the stats of each Pokemon or gaining a singular stat of each Pokemon. It's even capable of calculating the stats of a Pokemon when they power up much like the games themselves. 

Although I was inexperience with Java at the time, I was able to quickly learn the language and score perfectly on this assignment. This project taught me many fundamental elements of Java programing as well as how to work in a Repository. Learning these skills by participating in a fun project kept me motivated to learn more about the field of programming.
