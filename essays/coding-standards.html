 It’s one thing to write code that’s functional, but it’s another thing entirely to make code that’s functional and readable. 
 
 When I work alone, my code will often turn into a big mess of complicated jargon. This is often because I’m working in the pursuit of short term functionality without realizing the problems I’m creating in the future. Writing code neatly is an important and complementary skill to writing functional code. It makes programs more readable and easier to work with. Thus, for the long term health of any project, it’s always good to write neat code. 

 When working in VSCode, I was able to use the ESLint extension for the first time. ESLint acts to standardize code into a specific and readable format. Anytime code is written in a way that doesn’t align with the ESLint formatting, the plugin will mark the section as an error and comment on the type of error made. 

 In terms of making code organized, this plugin works wonders. It’s consistent, always catching errors that often go unnoticed. It’s also easy to use and it always tells the user where the errors are. However, getting used to the plugin takes some time. It can be annoying to fix some of the errors the plugin marks. The feedback isn’t always super intelligible, and the errors could be something minor. For example, an error could be a misplaced space somewhere on a line, and that space might not be super noticeable. Sometimes, I might also mistake an error for a different kind of error. In such an event, I might make drastic unnecessary changes to my code before finding the original error. 

 It can sometimes be challenging to fix all errors that ESLint marks. However, with enough time these errors should become trivial to fix, and the utility of ESLint will pay dividends. It’s always difficult to work on a project that I haven’t worked on in a while, it’s also difficult to work on a project with someone else's code. Having ESLint standardize all code can make the process of reading code much easier.
