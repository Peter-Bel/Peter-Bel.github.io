Designing Good Solutions



<img width="600px" class="img-fluid" src="../img/lintCode.png">

In programming, there’s a concept called “Design Patterns.” This term refers to repeatable, general solutions to common problems that arise in software development. For example, when building a user interface, a developer might use the "Model-View-Controller" (MVC) pattern to separate data logic from the user interface. This approach helps make code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable.

This seems like a simple idea, but I haven’t had much experience with this concept. Most of my coding currently comes from classwork, and homework assignments usually focus on learning new ideas through small, isolated projects. Because of this, it’s difficult to formulate or identify a recurring design pattern. However, it’s not impossible. While most classwork centers around exploring new concepts, it’s still important to code quickly and efficiently, especially during in-class WOD (Workout of the Day) assignments. These timed exercises require students to work in a focused and structured way.
To complete these WODs, I often rely on a light version of a design pattern strategy. For instance, some of the WODs involved learning Next.js and replicating an existing website. Problems like these tend to follow a similar pattern of actions. Most websites include standard components such as a navbar, a central image, an information section, and sometimes a unique element like a button with an image overlay. Given these similarities, I usually prepare for these assignments by mapping out the required steps for each part. Components like the navbar follow a predictable workflow: first, import similar code from a previous project, then update the text and color scheme, and finally add images if needed. Nearly every part of the website can be broken down into a flowchart-like decision process, and using this informal design pattern approach has made my coding more efficient.

I’ve also applied design pattern thinking in my own game development projects. There’s often a recurring structure when adding new game mechanics. First, I identify the necessary variables and objects. Then, I determine the interactions between those objects and what internal states are expected to change. Once I’ve mapped this out, I can implement the mechanic. It’s like creating a flowchart: the way objects interact dictates which variables are updated and what the resulting output will be. Thus, the development process becomes more manageable and systematic.
Ultimately, while I don’t feel very experienced with formal design patterns, I’ve already been using similar strategies to streamline my programming. These patterns help me approach class assignments and game design with a clearer path and a more organized mindset. Programming often involves solving similar problems again and again, so creating structured processes to handle those problems is a valuable skill. I hope to continue improving these skills to become a more effective and confident programmer.
