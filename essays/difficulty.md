	Computer science has become a powerful vehicle for innovative technologies and creative thinking. My personal journey through the field has been nothing but challenging, however, in return it has allowed me to better my critical thinking and create meaningful projects. I have especially engaged in game development and software development, and the progression I have made makes me motivated for the future. 
	
 Through class and personal projects, I’ve gained a lot of experience in Java, Python, C++, and HTML. Each language is unique and challenging in their own ways. However, they are all capable of dealing with logisitical computation and can be used to solve many problems. While some of the first things I learned like sorting algorithms felt simple, the more I study the more complicated the problems become. I’ve initially struggled with the object oriented coding of java. But in time, the language became easier and easier to comprehend. Using objects in java, I created a fishing simulator that can keep track of fish data. I’ve also practiced extensively on recursive functions through hackerrank and other programming platforms. 
	
 Programming has also allowed me to create meaningful art through games. Coding isn’t often seen as a creative field in the same sense as art. It’s often viewed as a rigid logic and math based medium. However, games can create a similar level of creative expressoin. Games are a sandbox, and that sandbox can be engineered towards a specific experience or feeling. Creating that sandbox is a creative and artistic process that takes a lot of experience and dedication. Through my time working with game engines, I’ve improved not only as a programmer, but also in my ability to collaborate and make creative decisions. My biggest game project had me collaborate with a good friend from high school. It was after months of work that we were able to create a deep and interactive platformer game. It also enabled us to tackle some extremely challenging computational problems and we became greater thinkers because of it. 
	
 My coding journey has allowed me to grow and create a lot of meaningful things. It’s from these experiences that keep me motivated to grow and develop future projects, and I’d love to work hard with others for this endevor.
